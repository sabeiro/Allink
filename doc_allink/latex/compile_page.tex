Allink is written in A\+N\+SI standard C++, and must be compiled from source. It was developed using the gnu gcc compiler in both linux and Mac OS X environments. The source code should compile with any standards compliant C++ compiler. The build system, however, is based on Unix makefiles, and so will work only in a unix (linux or mac) environment.

Source code for the class library is in the src directory. Examples of main programs and example input files are in the Examples directory.\hypertarget{compile_page_compile_library_section}{}\subsection{Compile}\label{compile_page_compile_library_section}
To compile the entire Allink package 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Edit /include/\+Make\+Include.mk and set the user defined flags. 
\item Run make.   
\end{DoxyItemize}

The resulting object $\ast$.o files for each class is placed in the same directory as the corresponding $\ast$.h and $\ast$.cpp source files. To clean up all of the $\ast$.o files and start over, enter \char`\"{}make clean\char`\"{} from the src directory.\hypertarget{compile_page_enable}{}\subsection{graphics}\label{compile_page_enable}
\hyperlink{classElPoly}{El\+Poly} has a visualisation tool if Open\+Gl libraries are installed. \hypertarget{compile_page_enable}{}\subsection{graphics}\label{compile_page_enable}
\hyperlink{classElPoly}{El\+Poly} uses for Delaunay triangulation the C\+G\+AL libraries.
