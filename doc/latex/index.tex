\-Allink is a collection of analysis, visualisation and image processing tools to study the physical properties of the following systems\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}\-Bilayer membrane\char`\"{}\-: mechanical properties (bending, stretching and coupling energies, diffusivity, pressure tensor...). 
\item \char`\"{}\-Signals\char`\"{}\-: statistical properties (power spectrum, autocorrelation, distribution...). 
\item \char`\"{}\-Images\char`\"{}\-: statistical properties, filters, reconstruction of lines. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\-Allink is as well an integrator of equation of motion, \-Monte \-Carlo simulator and differential equation solver for the following systems\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}\-Integrator\char`\"{}\-: molecular dynamics for polymers, rotating rigid cylinders. 
\item \char`\"{}\-Simulator\char`\"{}\-: \-Monte \-Carlo with configurational bias for lipid systems. 
\item \char`\"{}\-Solver\char`\"{}\-: for a forth order differential equation in 1 or 2d lattices. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\-Each tools needs a configuration file inside the directory they are run to change the default options. \-This solution is preferred to the extensive use of menus which slows down the development of the software but makes the program less user friendly.\par
 \-Some tools are still under development if they are not properly documented. \par
 \-The programming style is modular, ojected oriented but not abstract (no use of friend classes, templates...). \-This might cause inefficiency in the program and in the source writing but is meant to furnish a clear understanding of the algorithms.\par
 \-The program is still under clean up of obsolete function and conversion of some original italian variable names. \paragraph*{\-Table of contents\-: }
