\-Mol\-Mc\-D is not yet a mature simulation package, but aspires to become one. \-The core of \-Mol\-Mc\-D was developed by rewriting a package named \-P\-M\-C that is used in our group for \-N\-V\-T simulations of coarse-\/grained bead-\/spring models of flexible polymer liquids. \-Both \-P\-M\-C and \-Mol\-Mc\-D thus far provide only the features that we have needed for these simulations. \-P\-M\-C provides several sophisticated conformation sampling \-M\-C moves for these simple models, which have not all yet been ported to \-Mol\-Mc\-D. \-Once all of the features of \-P\-M\-C are ported to \-Mol\-Mcd, further development work will focus on \-Mol\-Mc\-D. \-Features of \-Mol\-Mc\-D and \-P\-M\-C include\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Efficient implementations of \-N\-V\-E and \-N\-V\-T molecular dynamics, and hybrid \-M\-D/\-M\-C \-Markov moves. 


\item \-Configuration bias conformation sampling moves for \-M\-C simulation of dense liquids of long, flexible linear polymers. \-P\-M\-C provides crankshaft, reptation, end regrowth, internal rebrigding, and re-\/bridging configuration bias moves. \-Thus far, only reptation and end-\/regrowth moves have been ported to \-Mol\-Mc\-D. 


\item \-P\-M\-C implements \char`\"{}alchemical\char`\"{} moves for semigrand-\/canonical simulations of homopolymer mixtures, and end-\/swap moves for diblock copolymers. \-Neither has yet been ported to \-Mol\-Mc\-D. 


\item \-Specialized species definitions for isolated point particles, linear homopolymers, and diblock copolymers. 


\end{DoxyItemize}\-Thus far, the only potential energy classes provided with \-Mol\-Mc\-D are a simple \-L\-J pair interaction and a harmonic bond potential. \-It does not yet support bending and dihedral potentials, or \-Coulomb interactions. \-We plan to add bond angle and dihedral potentials over the next few months, followed by \-Ewald and (later still) particle mesh \-Ewald implementations of electrostatic interactions.
