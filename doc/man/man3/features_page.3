features_page \- Current Features 
MolMcD is not yet a mature simulation package, but aspires to become one\&. The core of MolMcD was developed by rewriting a package named PMC that is used in our group for NVT simulations of coarse-grained bead-spring models of flexible polymer liquids\&. Both PMC and MolMcD thus far provide only the features that we have needed for these simulations\&. PMC provides several sophisticated conformation sampling MC moves for these simple models, which have not all yet been ported to MolMcD\&. Once all of the features of PMC are ported to MolMcd, further development work will focus on MolMcD\&. Features of MolMcD and PMC include: 
.PD 0

.IP "\(bu" 2
Efficient implementations of NVE and NVT molecular dynamics, and hybrid MD/MC Markov moves\&. 
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Configuration bias conformation sampling moves for MC simulation of dense liquids of long, flexible linear polymers\&. PMC provides crankshaft, reptation, end regrowth, internal rebrigding, and re-bridging configuration bias moves\&. Thus far, only reptation and end-regrowth moves have been ported to MolMcD\&. 
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
PMC implements 'alchemical' moves for semigrand-canonical simulations of homopolymer mixtures, and end-swap moves for diblock copolymers\&. Neither has yet been ported to MolMcD\&. 
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Specialized species definitions for isolated point particles, linear homopolymers, and diblock copolymers\&. 
.PP

.PP
Thus far, the only potential energy classes provided with MolMcD are a simple LJ pair interaction and a harmonic bond potential\&. It does not yet support bending and dihedral potentials, or Coulomb interactions\&. We plan to add bond angle and dihedral potentials over the next few months, followed by Ewald and (later still) particle mesh Ewald implementations of electrostatic interactions\&.
